# How to use these docs

- You can use the search bar in the top right to look for a specific query
- Page contents overview can be found in the right hand section of the page
- Sections can be found on the left sidebar
- The Journal is an informal document of my thought process throughout this project

## See [optional guide](optional-guide.md) for more.

This guide should give you additional information on finding what you need!

### Trying out header three :)
