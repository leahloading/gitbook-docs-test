Find a day by day account of project progress

## Header shows up here with nesting

### Day 1

Some learnings
- it's better to commit frequently 
- functions are objects in javascript

### Day 2

You can drag from a column's edge to resize it. Column resizing is stored as a percentage of the overall width, which allows for relative sizing based on the overall width of the table.

### Day 3

```javascript

    
    function helloWorld() {

        console.log("hello world")

    }

```

## Header on its own?
